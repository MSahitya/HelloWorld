1. Why to learn JAVA in 2025?
Still it is one of the popular language which runs on around 3 billion devices, like desktops,laptops,mobiles, Smart cards, Blu ray devices.
2. Why it is still so much popular?
Because of its Rich API's, Strong community support, Object Oriented , Can build Distributed applications easily. Write once and Run on anywhere nature.
3. What is a programming language?
to talk with machines we need to give instructions. for writing instructions we have different high level languages.
Each machine has its own processor's cpu instruction architecture. So when we write high level instructions compiler will convert it to machine code.
4. what is an algorithm?
Step by step instructions to solve a problem or performing a task.
5. what is Syntax?
Following the rules to write instructions.
6. History of Java?
First Rlease in 1995.
Java program-------->Compiler--------->interpreter from JVM(on the Windows Machine/Linux/other OS)
7. How java is Distributed?how it helps applications that support network?
Java's distribution and its role in supporting network applications are both integral to its widespread use. Here's a brief overview:

### **Java Distribution:**
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: The JDK includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), compilers, and tools needed for Java development. It's available from Oracle and other vendors like OpenJDK.
2. **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: The JRE includes the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), core libraries, and other components necessary to run Java applications. It's the runtime environment required to execute Java programs.
3. **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**: Tools like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans provide comprehensive environments for Java development, including coding, testing, and debugging.
4. **Package Managers**: Tools like Maven and Gradle manage project dependencies and automate the build process.

### **Java in Network Applications:**
1. **Platform Independence**: Java’s "write once, run anywhere" philosophy allows network applications to run on various devices and operating systems, making it ideal for distributed environments.
2. **Built-in Networking Libraries**: Java provides extensive networking capabilities through libraries such as java.net, which supports TCP/IP, UDP, and HTTP protocols.
3. **Java EE (Enterprise Edition)**: Java EE provides a robust platform for building large-scale, distributed, multi-tiered applications. It includes APIs for web services, communication, and data exchange.
4. **Socket Programming**: Java supports socket programming, enabling developers to create client-server applications that communicate over the network.
5. **Security**: Java offers strong security features, including encryption, authentication, and authorization, which are crucial for networked applications.
6. **Scalability and Performance**: Java’s ability to handle concurrent threads and manage resources efficiently makes it suitable for high-performance network applications.

By leveraging these features, Java helps developers create robust, secure, and scalable network applications that can run seamlessly across different platforms. 
8. What are the java versions?

Version	Release Date	LTS (Long-Term Support)	End of Public Updates	End of Extended Support
Java 23	September 17, 2024	No	March 2025	N/A
